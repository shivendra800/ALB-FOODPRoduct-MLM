            <p>ALB FOOD PRODUCTS believes in helping its customers as far as possible, and has therefore a liberal
                cancellation policy. Under this policy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made immediately after placing the order.
                        However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the
                        vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping them.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>ALB FOOD PRODUCTS does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers, eatables
                        etc. However, refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the quality of product
                        delivered is not good.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please report the same to our Customer Service
                        team. The request will, however, be entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the
                        same at his own end. This should be reported within same day of receipt of the products.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p> In case of complaints regarding products that come with a warranty from manufacturers, please refer
                        the issue to them.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        In case of any Refunds approved by the ALB FOOD PRODUCTS, itâ€™ll take 9-15 days for the refund to be
                        processed to the end customer.
                    </p>
